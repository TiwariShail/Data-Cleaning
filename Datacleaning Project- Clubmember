1) Selecting table to view the data 

Select * From clubmember 

2) Creating temp table in order to clean the table: 

Create table CCLUBMEMBER( 
FULL_NAME NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
AGE SMALLINT NULL, 
MARTIAL_STATUS NVARCHAR(50) NULL, 
EMAIL NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
PHONE NVARCHAR(50) NULL, 
FULL_ADDRESS NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 
JOB_TITLE NVARCHAR(50) NULL, 
MEMBERSHIP_DATE DATE NOT NULL 

3)Inserting Data from original file to temp file: 

INSERT INTO Cclubmember 
SELECT * FROM clubmember; 

4)Counting Number of records in new table 

Select Count(*) As record_count 
From Cclubmember 

5) Finding Duplicate email address: 
Select Email, Count(*) 
From CCLUBMEMBER 
Group By Email 
Having Count(*)>1 

 

6) Deleting Duplicates 
WITH DUPLICATE AS 
( 
Select *, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY EMAIL ORDER BY EMAIL) AS RN 
fROM Cclubmember 
) 
Delete From DUPLICATE 
WHERE RN>1 

7)Let's check again the count after deleting the duplicates: 

Select count(*) 
From Cclubmember

8)Finding count of Nulls from each column: 

Select Count(*) Totalrows, 
Count(*)-Count(Full_Name) As Fullnamenull, 
Count(*)-Count(Age) As AgeNull, 
Count(*)-Count(Martial_status) As Martialstatusnull,  
Count(*)-Count(Email) As EmailNull, 
Count(*)-Count(Phone) As PhoneNull, 
Count(*)-Count(Full_Address) As FullAddressNull, 
Count(*)-Count(Job_title) As JobtitleNull, 
Count(*)-Count(Membership_date) As MembershipdateNull 
From CCLUBMEMBER 

8)Trying to find if we can find replacement for Null value. For that we will use Join. The following query is for Martial_Status column: 

Select C1.Full_Name, C1.Martial_status, 
C2.Full_Name, C2.Martial_status 
From CCLUBMEMBER C1 
Inner Join CCLUBMEMBER C2 
ON 
C1.Full_Name=C2.Full_Name 
Where C1.Martial_status IS NULL AND C2.Martial_status IS NOT NULL 

 
Similarly for Job_Title: 

Select C1.Full_Name, C1.job_title, 
C2.Full_Name, C2.job_title 
From CCLUBMEMBER C1 
Inner Join CCLUBMEMBER C2 
ON 
C1.Full_Name=C2.Full_Name 
Where C1.job_title IS NULL AND C2.job_title IS NOT NULL 

 
9) In order to find Distinct values from the column. 

Select Distinct Martial_status 
From CCLUBMEMBER 

10) In Martial_status I found a spelling mistake. Following is the query to update the mistake: 

Update CCLUBMEMBER 
Set MARTIAL_STATUS= 'divorced' 
Where MARTIAL_STATUS= 'divored'
